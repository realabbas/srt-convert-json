1
00:02:38,914 --> 00:02:40,164
English!     I'm English!

2
00:05:40,052 --> 00:05:41,803
It's grenadiers, mate.

3
00:05:55,609 --> 00:05:56,943
Make way!

4
00:06:00,781 --> 00:06:02,365
Out of the way!

5
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:04,034
Go, go, go!

6
00:06:04,452 --> 00:06:06,327
Along the mole. All the way.

7
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:08,329
The ship's about to leave.

8
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:11,532
Along the mole. All the way.
The ship's about to leave.

9
00:07:45,636 --> 00:07:47,637
Where's the bloody air force?

10
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:37,353
The navy's requisitioned her.

11
00:08:37,521 --> 00:08:40,440
They'll be back in an hour.
My dad wants to be ready before then.

12
00:08:42,526 --> 00:08:45,153
They've told us to strip her
and load those life jackets.

13
00:08:45,404 --> 00:08:48,198
Some men across the Channel,
at Dunkirk, need taking off.

14
00:08:48,574 --> 00:08:49,616
Some men?

15
00:09:09,803 --> 00:09:11,888
Check fuel, Fortis 1 and 2.

16
00:09:16,143 --> 00:09:17,185
70 gallons.

17
00:09:19,521 --> 00:09:21,397
68 gallons, Fortis Leader.

18
00:09:22,274 --> 00:09:24,734
Stay down at 500 feet to leave fuel

19
00:09:24,818 --> 00:09:27,487
for 40-minute fighting time
over Dunkirk.

20
00:09:28,197 --> 00:09:31,115
Understood.
Vector 128, angels point five.

21
00:09:32,034 --> 00:09:34,452
And keep an eye on that gauge,
even when it gets lively.

22
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,537
Save enough to get back.

23
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:14,446

24
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:49,027
No French soldiers.
No French soldiers. No.

25
00:10:49,194 --> 00:10:52,572
No, no French. English only.
English only past this point.

26
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,158
No. It's a British ship.
No, you have your own ships.

27
00:10:55,326 --> 00:10:56,909
Get back. Get back.

28
00:10:57,077 --> 00:10:59,203
No, you've got your own ships.
This is a British ship.

29
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:00,705
No, get back.

30
00:11:00,873 --> 00:11:02,891
Look, get the stretchers through.
There are stretchers coming.

31
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,917
Get out of the way! Out of the way!

32
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:08,046
Go, go, go.
Along the mole. All the way.

33
00:11:08,213 --> 00:11:10,631
The ship's about to leave.
About to leave.

34
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,918
Along the mole. All the way.

35
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:14,260
Along the mole. Along the mole.
All the way. All the way.

36
00:11:14,511 --> 00:11:15,511
No.

37
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:18,389
No, English only. English only!

38
00:11:21,435 --> 00:11:22,435
No!

39
00:11:37,826 --> 00:11:39,202
Ready on the stern!

40
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,370
Yes, sir!

41
00:11:51,673 --> 00:11:53,132
Man the bowline!

42
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,717
Any more room?

43
00:12:02,267 --> 00:12:03,935
You have to get back!

44
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:13,277
That's two minutes.

45
00:12:13,445 --> 00:12:15,405
You've missed it. You've missed it.

46
00:12:43,684 --> 00:12:44,684
Is that the last one?

47
00:12:45,185 --> 00:12:46,269
Aye, sir.

48
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:50,273
Break the line.

49
00:12:54,027 --> 00:12:55,403
Come on! Come on!

50
00:13:51,793 --> 00:13:54,337
Dunkirk's so far.
Why can't they just load at Calais?

51
00:13:54,505 --> 00:13:57,006
The enemy
had something to say about it.

52
00:13:58,926 --> 00:14:01,719
Ah, down here we're sitting ducks.

53
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:04,555
Keep 'em peeled.
They'll come out of the sun.

54
00:14:17,361 --> 00:14:18,361
Up the line.

55
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:22,406
Oi. We'll take it.

56
00:14:24,743 --> 00:14:26,160
Drop the gangplank!

57
00:14:26,328 --> 00:14:27,328
Yes, sir!

58
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:45,763
Take a run at it.

59
00:15:15,627 --> 00:15:17,545
Ready on the stern line, George.

60
00:15:20,257 --> 00:15:21,799
Aren't you waiting on the navy?

61
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,010
They've asked for the Moonstone,
they'll have her.

62
00:15:24,177 --> 00:15:25,344
And her captain.

63
00:15:25,554 --> 00:15:27,722
And his son.

64
00:15:30,434 --> 00:15:31,976
Thanks for the help, George.

65
00:15:35,522 --> 00:15:37,023
What are you doing?

66
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,389
You do know where we're going?

67
00:15:40,193 --> 00:15:41,193
France.

68
00:15:42,738 --> 00:15:44,155
Into war, George.

69
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:46,407
I'll be useful, sir.

70
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,459
Bandit, 11 o'clock.

71
00:15:57,461 --> 00:15:58,669
Break.

72
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:13,225
He's on me.

73
00:16:15,604 --> 00:16:16,896
I'm on him.

74
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:55,059
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

75
00:16:55,268 --> 00:16:56,268
Oi, you two.

76
00:16:56,478 --> 00:16:57,812
Get a shift on.

77
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:02,358
Yeah, pull him tight. Tie a knot in it.

78
00:17:02,526 --> 00:17:04,443
Back up the line. Both of you.

79
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:06,028
Off you go.

80
00:17:06,196 --> 00:17:07,363
Off you go!

81
00:17:07,531 --> 00:17:09,865
That last barrage
has damaged the rudder.

82
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,367
Uh, okay...

83
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,828
Psst!

84
00:17:49,781 --> 00:17:50,781
Mr. Dawson!

85
00:17:50,949 --> 00:17:52,324
One of ours, George.

86
00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:04,647
On my mark, Fortis 2.
Draw him left.

87
00:19:06,817 --> 00:19:08,609
Three, two, one.

88
00:19:09,152 --> 00:19:10,194
Mark.

89
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:25,543
Clear.

90
00:19:28,964 --> 00:19:30,673
Is he down?

91
00:19:39,266 --> 00:19:40,516
Yeah, he's down for the count.

92
00:19:47,023 --> 00:19:49,233
Fortis Leader, one bandit down.

93
00:19:53,154 --> 00:19:55,030
Fortis Leader, do you read?

94
00:20:00,745 --> 00:20:04,290
Fortis 2, I have you to my port.
I have no eyes on Fortis Leader. Over.

95
00:20:04,457 --> 00:20:06,584
Understood, Fortis 1.

96
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:08,168
Orbit for a look.

97
00:20:20,891 --> 00:20:22,141
How long, Lieutenant?

98
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:25,394
We need to run a new cable, sir.
They're scrambling.

99
00:20:25,562 --> 00:20:26,854
Very well.

100
00:20:31,651 --> 00:20:34,570
Colonel, you're gonna have to decide
how many more wounded to evacuate.

101
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:37,323
One stretcher takes the space
of seven standing men.

102
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,574
Excuse me.

103
00:20:52,881 --> 00:20:54,715
- Rear Admiral.
- Commander.

104
00:20:57,302 --> 00:20:58,677
How's the perimeter?

105
00:20:58,845 --> 00:21:00,346
Shrinking every day.

106
00:21:00,805 --> 00:21:03,599
But between our rear guard
and the French, we're holding the line.

107
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,935
And the enemy tanks have stopped.

108
00:21:06,102 --> 00:21:07,478
Why have they stopped?

109
00:21:08,063 --> 00:21:09,188
Waste precious tanks

110
00:21:09,397 --> 00:21:11,249
when they can pick us off from the air,
like fish in a barrel?

111
00:21:11,274 --> 00:21:14,318
How long does London expect the army
to hold out before we make terms?

112
00:21:14,486 --> 00:21:15,486
Make terms?

113
00:21:16,154 --> 00:21:19,490
They're not stopping here.
We need to get our army back.

114
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:22,785
Britain's next
and then the rest of the world.

115
00:21:22,953 --> 00:21:24,036
Christ.

116
00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:27,373
I mean, you can practically see it
from here.

117
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,666
What?

118
00:21:29,584 --> 00:21:30,834
Home.

119
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,545
What about the French?

120
00:21:33,713 --> 00:21:36,048
Publicly, Churchill's told them,
"Bras dessous."

121
00:21:36,216 --> 00:21:38,217
Arm in arm, leaving together.

122
00:21:38,426 --> 00:21:39,635
And privately?

123
00:21:39,803 --> 00:21:41,303
We need our army back.

124
00:21:41,888 --> 00:21:43,931
How many men
are they talking about, sir?

125
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:48,435
Churchill wants 30,000.
Ramsay's hoping we can give him 45.

126
00:21:50,021 --> 00:21:52,272
There are 400,000 men
on this beach, sir.

127
00:21:53,233 --> 00:21:55,359
We'll just have to do our best.

128
00:21:56,528 --> 00:21:59,071
Right, well, this mole stays open
at all costs.

129
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:04,243
We're in artillery range from the west.
If anything else sinks here,

130
00:22:04,411 --> 00:22:06,412
the mole's blocked and we're stuffed.

131
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:08,122
Can't we load from the beaches?

132
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:09,975
Better than standing out here
when the dive bombs come.

133
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,375
- It's impossible.
- Too shallow?

134
00:22:11,543 --> 00:22:13,561
'Cause anything that drafts
over three feet can't get near.

135
00:22:13,586 --> 00:22:16,672
We don't have enough small boats
to ferry men to the destroyers.

136
00:22:17,215 --> 00:22:20,092
The mole it is, then, gentlemen.

137
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:10,601
Hey!

138
00:23:11,561 --> 00:23:13,729
Hey! Can you swim it?

139
00:23:15,774 --> 00:23:16,940
Dad, can you get closer?

140
00:23:17,692 --> 00:23:19,151
Can't risk it!

141
00:23:20,737 --> 00:23:21,737
Hang on.

142
00:24:11,329 --> 00:24:12,579
What's your name?

143
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,100
Wreckage below.

144
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,061
Is it more of the 109?

145
00:24:36,229 --> 00:24:37,396
No.

146
00:24:37,689 --> 00:24:39,356
It's Fortis Leader. Over.

147
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:41,859
You think he got out?

148
00:24:42,068 --> 00:24:43,068
I didn't see a 'chute.

149
00:24:44,863 --> 00:24:46,822
Record his position.

150
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:49,199
Then set heading 128,

151
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:51,243
height 1,000. Over.

152
00:24:51,411 --> 00:24:53,495
Vector 128, angels one. Understood.

153
00:24:59,544 --> 00:25:00,878
Fortis 2, what's your fuel?

154
00:25:02,255 --> 00:25:03,380
50 gallons. Over.

155
00:25:03,882 --> 00:25:06,216
50 gallons.

156
00:25:09,846 --> 00:25:11,763
All right, keep letting me know.

157
00:25:11,931 --> 00:25:13,724
My gauge took a bit of a knock
back there.

158
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,810
Shouldn't you turn back?

159
00:25:16,978 --> 00:25:18,478
No, no.

160
00:25:19,105 --> 00:25:21,481
I'm fairly confident
it's just the gauge.

161
00:26:50,696 --> 00:26:52,738
- She's going down!
- Cut her loose!

162
00:26:52,906 --> 00:26:53,990
What about the wounded?

163
00:26:55,284 --> 00:26:57,660
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

164
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:01,497
Cut her loose, and push her off!

165
00:27:01,665 --> 00:27:03,416
We can't let her sink at the mole!

166
00:27:04,126 --> 00:27:05,960
Push the bloody boat off!

167
00:27:13,427 --> 00:27:14,427
Help us!

168
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:29,627
Do you want to come below?

169
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:31,712
It's much warmer.

170
00:28:32,631 --> 00:28:33,798
It's out of the wind.

171
00:28:33,965 --> 00:28:35,383
Here you go.

172
00:28:38,095 --> 00:28:39,678
Leave him be, George.

173
00:28:39,846 --> 00:28:41,680
He feels safer on deck.

174
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:44,266
You would too if you'd been bombed.

175
00:28:44,434 --> 00:28:45,434
U-boat.

176
00:28:47,771 --> 00:28:49,939
It was a U-boat.

177
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,152
Get him some more tea, George.

178
00:29:10,168 --> 00:29:12,461
Right,
we're about five minutes out,

179
00:29:12,629 --> 00:29:15,589
so climb to 2,000. Over.
That's more fuel.

180
00:29:15,757 --> 00:29:17,442
I know, but I don't want
to get jumped again.

181
00:29:17,467 --> 00:29:18,586
Let's get a decent altitude.

182
00:29:18,635 --> 00:29:20,594
We can dive down on the bastards
from above. Over.

183
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,221
Understood. Angels two.

184
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:23,389
Over.

185
00:29:25,892 --> 00:29:26,892
Right, Highlanders.

186
00:29:27,436 --> 00:29:29,019
Let's find you another ship.

187
00:30:41,134 --> 00:30:42,134
Come on.

188
00:30:45,138 --> 00:30:47,723
Everyone else, keep climbing.
Climb on the deck.

189
00:30:48,266 --> 00:30:51,018
Climb on the deck.

190
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,562
Watch your heads on the rail.
Watch it.

191
00:30:55,273 --> 00:30:57,107
That's right, keep going down.
Take a blanket.

192
00:30:57,275 --> 00:30:58,594
Down you go.
Put this on, my love.

193
00:30:59,194 --> 00:31:02,071
Down you go. Keep going down.

194
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:04,365
There's a nice cup of tea
for you down there.

195
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:05,533
Keep moving down.

196
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,368
Take a blanket.

197
00:31:08,578 --> 00:31:09,578
Try and make some room.

198
00:31:09,746 --> 00:31:11,163
Keep moving down, boys.

199
00:31:12,499 --> 00:31:13,582
This way.

200
00:31:14,709 --> 00:31:16,293
A cup of tea down there.

201
00:31:41,027 --> 00:31:43,988
There you go. Down there.
Move down there.

202
00:32:03,216 --> 00:32:04,675
What's wrong with your friend?

203
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:25,348
He's looking for a quick way out.

204
00:32:27,699 --> 00:32:29,116
In case we go down.

205
00:33:07,656 --> 00:33:09,073
Where are we going?

206
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,741
Dunkirk.

207
00:33:12,786 --> 00:33:14,870
No, uh, no, no,
we're going to England.

208
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:18,582
We have to go to Dunkirk first.

209
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:21,919
Look, I'm not going back.

210
00:33:23,338 --> 00:33:24,880
I'm not going back.

211
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,132
Look at it.

212
00:33:28,385 --> 00:33:30,010
If we go there, we'll die.

213
00:33:37,185 --> 00:33:38,185
I see your point, son.

214
00:33:39,062 --> 00:33:41,146
Well, let's plot a course.

215
00:33:44,484 --> 00:33:47,152
You can take your tea below
and warm up.

216
00:33:49,739 --> 00:33:52,324
Peter, have we got space
for a man to lie down?

217
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:53,867
Uh, yeah.

218
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,666
Here, come on.

219
00:34:06,047 --> 00:34:07,047
Careful.

220
00:34:09,467 --> 00:34:10,634
Careful.

221
00:34:16,975 --> 00:34:18,267
Just in there.

222
00:34:19,018 --> 00:34:20,477
I'll get you some more tea.

223
00:34:37,245 --> 00:34:38,787
Is he a coward, Mr. Dawson?

224
00:34:38,955 --> 00:34:40,581
He's shell-shocked, George.

225
00:34:40,749 --> 00:34:42,332
He's not himself.

226
00:34:45,086 --> 00:34:47,463
He may never be himself again.

227
00:34:56,014 --> 00:34:57,222
Here you are.

228
00:35:14,783 --> 00:35:16,700
40 gallons, Fortis 1.

229
00:35:18,244 --> 00:35:19,369
40 gallons, understood.

230
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:25,000
Heinkel, 11 o'clock.

231
00:35:25,418 --> 00:35:28,337
She's lining up to drop her load
on that minesweeper.

232
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:29,505
Fighters?

233
00:35:29,672 --> 00:35:32,132
Yeah, 109s off her starboard.

234
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:34,676
I'm on the bomber.

235
00:36:26,479 --> 00:36:27,479
Got him! Got him!

236
00:36:59,846 --> 00:37:01,638
Oh, she's turning.
You must've damaged her.

237
00:37:02,015 --> 00:37:03,223
Where's the escort?

238
00:37:03,391 --> 00:37:04,558
Well, I got one of—

239
00:37:05,226 --> 00:37:06,226
Jesus!

240
00:37:25,038 --> 00:37:26,288
I'm going down.

241
00:37:26,456 --> 00:37:27,998
I'm on him. Bail out.

242
00:37:48,186 --> 00:37:49,745
No, the swell looks good. I'm ditching.

243
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:11,833
Don't leave us!

244
00:38:12,752 --> 00:38:14,336
Come back!

245
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:17,381
- Wait for us!
- Help! Help us!

246
00:38:20,218 --> 00:38:23,637
Pick us up! Pick us up!

247
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,809
Come back!

248
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:31,770
Torpedo!

249
00:39:03,052 --> 00:39:07,014
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

250
00:40:53,538 --> 00:40:54,746
Help!

251
00:40:54,914 --> 00:40:56,581
Get us out of here!

252
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:12,597
Spitfires, George.

253
00:41:12,765 --> 00:41:15,100
Greatest plane ever built.

254
00:41:18,938 --> 00:41:19,938
You didn't even look.

255
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:23,275
Rolls-Royce Merlin engines.

256
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:27,320
Sweetest sound you could hear out here.

257
00:41:28,114 --> 00:41:29,114
Hello?

258
00:41:30,783 --> 00:41:32,784
Could you open the door?

259
00:41:32,952 --> 00:41:34,494
Hello? Can you hear me?

260
00:41:36,038 --> 00:41:38,331
Open the door!

261
00:41:38,749 --> 00:41:40,125
Do you hear me?

262
00:41:42,461 --> 00:41:43,753
He wants to come out.

263
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:45,922
What have you done? Locked him in?

264
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:47,591
Let him out, for God's sake.

265
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:48,758
Hello?

266
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,387
Let me out!

267
00:42:06,903 --> 00:42:09,362
You haven't turned around.

268
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:13,742
No. We have a job to do.

269
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,288
Job?
This is a pleasure yacht.

270
00:42:18,456 --> 00:42:21,249
You're weekend sailors,
not the bloody navy.

271
00:42:21,918 --> 00:42:23,543
A man your age?

272
00:42:24,003 --> 00:42:26,463
Men my age dictate this war.

273
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:29,341
Why should we be allowed
to send our children to fight it?

274
00:42:29,508 --> 00:42:31,259
You should be at home!

275
00:42:31,344 --> 00:42:35,013
Well, there won't be any home if we
allow a slaughter across the Channel.

276
00:42:42,063 --> 00:42:43,742
He's turning tail.
I'm gonna get after him.

277
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:46,691
Good luck.

278
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:49,861
Watch your fuel. You're at 15 gallons.

279
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:53,949
15 gallons, understood.

280
00:42:56,035 --> 00:42:57,619
Best of luck, Collins.

281
00:43:00,665 --> 00:43:02,832
Collins, do you read?

282
00:44:04,645 --> 00:44:06,813
Oi! No! No!

283
00:44:06,981 --> 00:44:08,690
Get off! Get off!

284
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:11,067
Piss off, the both of you.
It's too crowded.

285
00:44:11,235 --> 00:44:12,485
You can't leave us!

286
00:44:13,571 --> 00:44:14,612
Make some room!

287
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,780
No!

288
00:44:16,699 --> 00:44:17,991
No! Get off!

289
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:19,677
You men, leave off.
You'll capsize the boat.

290
00:44:19,702 --> 00:44:21,870
She's gone over twice
on the way out here.

291
00:44:22,038 --> 00:44:23,806
You have to stay calm.
There are plenty of boats.

292
00:44:23,831 --> 00:44:24,831
Calm?

293
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:27,250
Wait till you get torpedoed,
then tell us to be calm!

294
00:44:27,793 --> 00:44:29,085
You have life jackets?

295
00:44:29,253 --> 00:44:30,587
Yes, they do.

296
00:44:30,755 --> 00:44:32,714
Don't panic, boys.
The water's not too rough

297
00:44:32,882 --> 00:44:33,965
or too cold.

298
00:44:34,133 --> 00:44:35,675
We're heading back to the beach.

299
00:44:35,843 --> 00:44:38,094
- Let's go to Dover!
- Yeah!

300
00:44:38,846 --> 00:44:40,656
We can't make it across the Channel
in this, lads.

301
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:44,142
We need to get back to the beach
and wait for another ride.

302
00:44:44,477 --> 00:44:47,270
You men in the water, float here,
save your strength.

303
00:44:47,438 --> 00:44:48,980
We'll come back for you.

304
00:44:49,148 --> 00:44:50,148
Oars in!

305
00:44:51,275 --> 00:44:53,985
Together, pull!

306
00:44:55,237 --> 00:44:57,530
Together, pull!

307
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:00,867
Pull!

308
00:45:01,911 --> 00:45:04,079
Together, pull!

309
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:07,332
Pull!

310
00:45:08,918 --> 00:45:11,378
Together, pull!

311
00:45:14,632 --> 00:45:16,800
There's no hiding from this, son.

312
00:45:19,095 --> 00:45:21,763
What is it you think you can do
out there, on this thing?

313
00:45:21,972 --> 00:45:25,100
There's not just us. A call went out.

314
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:27,310
We aren't the only ones
to answer, you know.

315
00:45:27,478 --> 00:45:29,145
You don't even have guns.

316
00:45:29,522 --> 00:45:30,522
Do you have a gun?

317
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:33,441
Yes, of course. A rifle, a 303.

318
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:36,653
Did it help you against the dive bombers
and the U-boats?

319
00:45:37,863 --> 00:45:39,531
You're an old fool.

320
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:42,575
I'm not going back.

321
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,411
I'm not going back.

322
00:45:45,121 --> 00:45:46,121
Turn it around.

323
00:45:47,206 --> 00:45:48,623
I'm not turning round.

324
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:50,458
Turn it around!

325
00:45:52,211 --> 00:45:53,420
Turn it—

326
00:45:55,423 --> 00:45:56,942
- Calm it down, mate.
- Turn it around!

327
00:45:57,049 --> 00:45:58,049
Wait, wait!

328
00:45:58,217 --> 00:45:59,634
Calm it down, mate.

329
00:46:01,095 --> 00:46:02,095
George?

330
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:03,930
George!

331
00:46:06,725 --> 00:46:07,725
What have you done?

332
00:46:09,437 --> 00:46:10,895
Okay, you're all right, George.

333
00:46:11,647 --> 00:46:12,814
You're all right.

334
00:46:13,524 --> 00:46:16,526
Hang on. Okay. Okay, just...

335
00:46:16,694 --> 00:46:18,194
That's it. That's good enough.

336
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:21,281
It's gonna keep some pressure on.
There we go.

337
00:46:21,449 --> 00:46:23,032
There we go.

338
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,451
Can you hear me, George?

339
00:48:59,023 --> 00:49:00,481
Come on, lads!

340
00:49:01,775 --> 00:49:04,611
Come on! Come on, boys!

341
00:51:10,111 --> 00:51:11,278
It's a pier.

342
00:51:12,363 --> 00:51:13,947
For when the water comes in.

343
00:51:18,494 --> 00:51:19,870
The tide's turning now.

344
00:51:21,956 --> 00:51:22,956
How can you tell?

345
00:51:25,418 --> 00:51:26,877
The bodies come back.

346
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:58,700
Hey.

347
00:52:11,047 --> 00:52:12,714
Hey, Highlanders!

348
00:52:22,642 --> 00:52:24,309
Hey, Highlanders!

349
00:52:24,477 --> 00:52:25,685
What's that way?

350
00:52:26,312 --> 00:52:27,354
A boat.

351
00:52:27,522 --> 00:52:28,897
She's grounded.

352
00:52:29,065 --> 00:52:31,149
Not when the tide comes in, she's not.

353
00:52:48,417 --> 00:52:51,044
Be a brave lad.

354
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:55,048
You and Mr. Dawson?

355
00:52:57,134 --> 00:52:58,533
It's the best thing I've ever done.

356
00:52:59,303 --> 00:53:01,721
You're all right. You're okay.

357
00:53:12,775 --> 00:53:15,277
Sea Cadet.
It's the only thing I've ever done.

358
00:53:15,444 --> 00:53:17,612
It's all right. It's okay.
Just have some water.

359
00:53:20,449 --> 00:53:22,117
I told my dad...

360
00:53:22,285 --> 00:53:24,452
I've done nothing at school

361
00:53:26,372 --> 00:53:28,540
and that I would do something one day.

362
00:53:31,335 --> 00:53:33,795
Maybe get in the local paper.

363
00:53:34,046 --> 00:53:36,256
Maybe my teachers would see it.

364
00:53:36,424 --> 00:53:37,966
Okay, get some rest.

365
00:53:38,634 --> 00:53:41,136
I need you back up on deck
as soon as you're able.

366
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:43,430
I can't.

367
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,682
What?

368
00:53:49,604 --> 00:53:51,837
I can't see.
Sir.

369
00:54:53,209 --> 00:54:55,669
The French have been forced back
on the western side.

370
00:54:56,587 --> 00:54:57,946
They're still holding a perimeter?

371
00:54:58,089 --> 00:54:59,089
For now.

372
00:55:00,675 --> 00:55:02,914
Officer coming through.
Move yourselves. Move yourselves!

373
00:55:13,729 --> 00:55:15,063
Where are the destroyers?

374
00:55:15,231 --> 00:55:16,773
There'll be one soon.

375
00:55:19,902 --> 00:55:20,902
One?

376
00:55:21,028 --> 00:55:23,613
After yesterday's losses,
it's one ship on the mole at a time.

377
00:55:23,781 --> 00:55:24,864
The battle is here.

378
00:55:25,032 --> 00:55:26,591
What the hell are they saving them for?

379
00:55:26,701 --> 00:55:28,159
The next battle.

380
00:55:28,327 --> 00:55:29,786
The one for Britain.

381
00:55:29,954 --> 00:55:31,913
It's the same with the planes.

382
00:55:34,041 --> 00:55:35,667
But it's right there.

383
00:55:36,377 --> 00:55:37,377
You can practically—

384
00:55:37,545 --> 00:55:39,587
Seeing home doesn't help us
get there, Colonel.

385
00:55:39,755 --> 00:55:41,715
They need to send more ships.

386
00:55:42,633 --> 00:55:44,217
Every hour the enemy pushes closer.

387
00:55:45,052 --> 00:55:47,053
They've activated
the small vessels pool.

388
00:55:48,014 --> 00:55:49,014
Small vessels?

389
00:55:49,181 --> 00:55:51,641
It's the list of civilian boats
for requisition.

390
00:55:52,143 --> 00:55:53,143
Civilian?

391
00:55:54,979 --> 00:55:56,730
We need destroyers.

392
00:55:56,897 --> 00:55:58,648
Small boats can load from the beach.

393
00:55:58,816 --> 00:56:00,066
Not in these conditions.

394
00:56:00,234 --> 00:56:02,736
Well, I'd rather face waves
than dive bombers.

395
00:56:05,698 --> 00:56:08,450
No, you're right.
They won't get up in this.

396
00:56:09,785 --> 00:56:12,579
The Royal Engineers are building piers
from lorries.

397
00:56:12,747 --> 00:56:15,373
At least that should help us
when the tide comes back.

398
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:17,709
Well, we'll know in six hours' time.

399
00:56:18,711 --> 00:56:20,190
I thought the tides were every three?

400
00:56:21,964 --> 00:56:24,758
Then it's good that you're army
and I'm navy, isn't it?

401
00:56:26,218 --> 00:56:28,511
There. Vanquisher.

402
00:56:43,319 --> 00:56:44,527
Where's the crew?

403
00:56:44,695 --> 00:56:46,571
Probably got spooked
after they ran aground.

404
00:56:47,364 --> 00:56:50,300
Scarpered up the beach.
Why?

405
00:56:50,534 --> 00:56:53,745
'Cause we're outside the perimeter.
Enemy could be right there.

406
00:56:54,914 --> 00:56:57,332
All right,
best shut ourselves inside, boys.

407
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,500
Wait for the high tide.

408
00:56:58,667 --> 00:57:00,251
How long's that?

409
00:57:00,419 --> 00:57:02,045
Every three hours.

410
00:57:25,611 --> 00:57:27,695
I've put a bit of pressure on it.

411
00:57:27,863 --> 00:57:29,823
Strapped him up, made him comfortable.

412
00:57:31,075 --> 00:57:32,075
What?

413
00:57:34,411 --> 00:57:35,411
It's bad, Dad.

414
00:57:38,415 --> 00:57:39,916
Well, should we turn back?

415
00:57:46,298 --> 00:57:47,298
We've come so far.

416
00:57:48,676 --> 00:57:50,176
Dad, is that one of ours?

417
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:55,014
That's a Heinkel.
They'll go for that minesweeper there.

418
00:57:55,516 --> 00:57:57,451
Hang on. Shouldn't we stand by
to pick up survivors?

419
00:57:57,476 --> 00:57:59,352
To do that we have to survive ourselves.

420
00:58:04,108 --> 00:58:06,276
Poke your head out.
See if the water's come in.

421
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:13,241
Talkative sod, aren't you?

422
00:58:39,351 --> 00:58:41,144
It's barely come in at all.

423
00:58:41,312 --> 00:58:43,479
- Fuck's sake.
- Calm down.

424
00:58:43,647 --> 00:58:45,815
What goes out
comes back in again, right?

425
00:58:45,983 --> 00:58:47,400
Yeah, but how long?

426
00:59:04,001 --> 00:59:06,901
Spitfires!
Come on.

427
00:59:13,552 --> 00:59:14,594
Come on, come on.

428
00:59:23,354 --> 00:59:24,687
Dad, he got him!

429
00:59:24,855 --> 00:59:26,439
Yeah! Yeah!

430
00:59:33,781 --> 00:59:35,323
The Heinkel's moving off.

431
00:59:40,454 --> 00:59:41,454
Yeah.

432
00:59:43,082 --> 00:59:44,082
Oh, no.

433
00:59:46,043 --> 00:59:47,835
Smoke from the Spitfire!

434
00:59:49,171 --> 00:59:51,005
Watch for a parachute!

435
00:59:57,846 --> 00:59:58,846
Oi.

436
01:00:03,852 --> 01:00:05,520
Oi. Oi.

437
01:00:51,567 --> 01:00:52,900
Are you German?

438
01:00:53,068 --> 01:00:54,402
No, Dutch. Dutch!

439
01:00:55,779 --> 01:00:56,779
Merchant navy.

440
01:00:57,614 --> 01:00:59,115
Here to pick you up. To help you.

441
01:00:59,283 --> 01:01:00,950
Why'd you leave your boat?

442
01:01:01,118 --> 01:01:02,368
In case the Germans come.

443
01:01:02,995 --> 01:01:05,079
We wait up the beach.

444
01:01:05,247 --> 01:01:06,873
With the soldiers.
Wait for the tide.

445
01:01:07,041 --> 01:01:09,334
You came back. The tide must be in.

446
01:01:10,502 --> 01:01:12,211
Coming. Coming, yes.

447
01:01:12,671 --> 01:01:14,547
But more hours till we float.

448
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:15,840
Hours?

449
01:01:16,008 --> 01:01:17,467
Why'd you come back?

450
01:01:19,386 --> 01:01:20,553
Not so heavy when I left.

451
01:01:33,817 --> 01:01:35,401
No 'chute!

452
01:01:40,449 --> 01:01:41,449
Best of luck, Collins.

453
01:01:46,997 --> 01:01:48,873
Collins, do you read?

454
01:02:14,983 --> 01:02:16,025
He's down.

455
01:02:59,153 --> 01:03:00,153
Dad.

456
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,529
Dad, watch the engine.

457
01:03:02,406 --> 01:03:04,866
Dad, he's down.
There was no 'chute.

458
01:03:09,163 --> 01:03:10,496
Dad, come on.
There was no 'chute.

459
01:03:11,498 --> 01:03:12,498
He's probably dead.

460
01:03:12,666 --> 01:03:14,834
Damn it, I hear you, Peter!
I hear you!

461
01:03:18,172 --> 01:03:19,881
He may be alive. Maybe.

462
01:03:21,925 --> 01:03:23,759
We may be able to help him.

463
01:04:17,356 --> 01:04:19,607
No! Then they'll know we're in here.

464
01:04:19,775 --> 01:04:21,275
Why else are they shooting at us?

465
01:04:21,777 --> 01:04:23,319
Look at the grouping.

466
01:04:27,157 --> 01:04:28,616
Target practice.

467
01:05:29,845 --> 01:05:33,264
Go. Plug it. Go, go.

468
01:05:53,493 --> 01:05:54,785
We have to plug it.

469
01:05:54,953 --> 01:05:56,621
After you, mate.

470
01:06:18,685 --> 01:06:20,186
You ready? Go!

471
01:06:24,858 --> 01:06:27,360
How do we get off?
Do we need to ditch some ballast?

472
01:06:27,778 --> 01:06:29,570
Weight! Do we need to lose weight?

473
01:06:29,738 --> 01:06:31,489
Weight. Weight, yes.

474
01:06:31,657 --> 01:06:32,990
Yes.

475
01:06:33,158 --> 01:06:34,533
Somebody needs to get off.

476
01:06:35,577 --> 01:06:36,994
Well volunteered.

477
01:06:37,162 --> 01:06:38,704
We don't need a volunteer.

478
01:06:39,164 --> 01:06:40,790
I know someone who ought to get off.

479
01:06:43,251 --> 01:06:44,251
This one.

480
01:06:45,587 --> 01:06:46,879
He's a German spy.

481
01:06:47,047 --> 01:06:48,422
Don't be daft.

482
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:50,132
He's a fucking Jerry.

483
01:06:51,009 --> 01:06:53,094
Have you noticed he hasn't said a word?

484
01:06:54,805 --> 01:06:55,971
'Cause I have.

485
01:06:56,848 --> 01:06:57,848
He don't speak English.

486
01:06:58,016 --> 01:07:01,185
If he does it's with an accent
that's thicker than sauerkraut sauce.

487
01:07:01,353 --> 01:07:03,062
You're daft. Tell him.

488
01:07:03,605 --> 01:07:04,814
Yeah.

489
01:07:08,193 --> 01:07:10,611
Tell me.

490
01:07:35,721 --> 01:07:36,971
Tell me, Gibson.

491
01:07:45,021 --> 01:07:46,021
Tell me!

492
01:07:47,107 --> 01:07:48,607
Tell him, for God's sake!

493
01:07:57,451 --> 01:07:59,076
A frog.

494
01:07:59,536 --> 01:08:01,078
A bloody frog.

495
01:08:01,830 --> 01:08:04,915
A cowardly little queue-jumping frog.

496
01:08:05,584 --> 01:08:06,959
Who's Gibson, eh?

497
01:08:07,127 --> 01:08:09,587
Some naked, dead Englishman
lying out on that sand?

498
01:08:09,755 --> 01:08:11,797
Did you at least have the decency
to bury him?

499
01:08:12,007 --> 01:08:13,886
He did. I helped him.
I thought it was his mate.

500
01:08:13,967 --> 01:08:15,360
- Maybe he killed him.
- He didn't kill him.

501
01:08:15,385 --> 01:08:16,385
How do we know?

502
01:08:16,553 --> 01:08:18,971
How hard is it to find a dead Englishman
on Dunkirk beach?

503
01:08:19,139 --> 01:08:20,389
He didn't kill anyone.

504
01:08:20,557 --> 01:08:23,076
He was just looking for a way
off the sand, like the rest of us.

505
01:08:28,148 --> 01:08:29,857
Haven't they had enough practice
by now?

506
01:08:30,025 --> 01:08:32,026
They're trying to make sure
she won't float.

507
01:08:32,194 --> 01:08:33,694
Will she still float?

508
01:08:33,862 --> 01:08:35,654
Float, yes. Yes, with less weight.

509
01:08:37,324 --> 01:08:38,508
And we know who's getting off.

510
01:08:38,533 --> 01:08:40,659
No, you can't do that.
He's French. He's on our side.

511
01:08:40,827 --> 01:08:42,328
Go on. Up you go.

512
01:08:42,496 --> 01:08:44,747
As soon as he pokes his head out,
they'll slaughter him.

513
01:08:44,915 --> 01:08:46,165
Better him than me.

514
01:08:46,333 --> 01:08:47,500
It's not fair.

515
01:08:47,667 --> 01:08:48,959
Survival's not fair.

516
01:08:49,127 --> 01:08:50,127
No, it's shit.

517
01:08:51,004 --> 01:08:53,339
It's fear, and it's greed.

518
01:08:53,507 --> 01:08:55,508
Fate pushed through the bowels of men.

519
01:08:55,675 --> 01:08:56,675
Shit.

520
01:08:58,178 --> 01:08:59,428
He saved our lives.

521
01:08:59,596 --> 01:09:00,846
And he's about to do it again.

522
01:09:01,014 --> 01:09:02,056
No, don't! Stop!

523
01:09:03,391 --> 01:09:06,769
Somebody's gotta get off,
so the rest of us can live.

524
01:09:07,521 --> 01:09:08,562
If you wanna volunteer—

525
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:09,897
Fuck no.

526
01:09:10,148 --> 01:09:11,148
I'm going home.

527
01:09:11,858 --> 01:09:13,484
And if this is the price?

528
01:09:18,448 --> 01:09:19,615
I'll live with it.

529
01:09:20,242 --> 01:09:21,242
But it's wrong.

530
01:09:22,035 --> 01:09:23,035
Go on!

531
01:09:25,121 --> 01:09:27,122
One man's not going to make
enough difference.

532
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:29,649
You'd best hope it does,
because you'd be volunteering next.

533
01:09:30,544 --> 01:09:31,544
What?

534
01:09:32,379 --> 01:09:34,296
We're regimental brothers, mate.

535
01:09:34,923 --> 01:09:36,298
It's just the way it is.

536
01:09:46,309 --> 01:09:47,685
We float!

537
01:09:48,395 --> 01:09:49,520
We float!

538
01:09:50,230 --> 01:09:51,814
Start the bloody engine!

539
01:10:30,186 --> 01:10:31,604
Afternoon.

540
01:11:26,952 --> 01:11:29,328
I'm sorry, son. I really don't know.

541
01:11:31,998 --> 01:11:33,749
You're right not moving him.

542
01:11:37,337 --> 01:11:38,837
You've done the best for him you can.

543
01:11:50,934 --> 01:11:52,101
We've wasted the day.

544
01:11:52,268 --> 01:11:54,311
I share your frustration, Colonel.

545
01:11:55,855 --> 01:11:56,855
Johnny!

546
01:12:03,822 --> 01:12:05,739
Grounded trawler, taking fire.

547
01:12:05,907 --> 01:12:07,950
They're breaking through the dunes
to the east.

548
01:12:11,746 --> 01:12:13,163
This is it.

549
01:12:21,256 --> 01:12:22,339
Plug the holes!

550
01:12:22,507 --> 01:12:23,799
With what?

551
01:12:34,728 --> 01:12:36,603
Plug the holes!

552
01:12:38,356 --> 01:12:41,150
Other side! Other side!

553
01:13:30,950 --> 01:13:32,409
What do you see?

554
01:13:39,292 --> 01:13:40,626
Home.

555
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:37,200
Is he all right? The boy?

556
01:15:39,203 --> 01:15:40,453
No.

557
01:15:40,621 --> 01:15:42,288
No, he's not.

558
01:15:53,717 --> 01:15:54,717
Dad!

559
01:16:02,601 --> 01:16:04,894
Come on. Come on, Farrier. Come on.

560
01:16:23,872 --> 01:16:25,456
There's men in the water!

561
01:17:10,794 --> 01:17:11,794
Oil.

562
01:17:13,255 --> 01:17:15,756
It's oil. Oil. You're getting into oil!

563
01:17:51,209 --> 01:17:52,668
Keep coming.

564
01:17:53,587 --> 01:17:55,004
Plenty of room.

565
01:18:00,052 --> 01:18:01,844
All right, below deck.

566
01:18:37,923 --> 01:18:39,799
Abandon ship!

567
01:19:02,072 --> 01:19:04,365
Gibson! Leave it!

568
01:19:47,367 --> 01:19:48,534
Below decks.

569
01:20:37,459 --> 01:20:39,658
Listen, we have to get
as many of you on board as we can

570
01:20:39,794 --> 01:20:40,953
before that oil catches fire.

571
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:43,714
You go below decks or you get
off my boat. That's your choice.

572
01:20:46,635 --> 01:20:48,385
Keep coming.

573
01:20:49,721 --> 01:20:52,223
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Careful! Careful down there!

574
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:53,682
Careful! Careful down there!

575
01:20:55,727 --> 01:20:57,853
He's dead, mate.

576
01:21:02,442 --> 01:21:04,568
So be bloody careful with him.

577
01:21:26,591 --> 01:21:28,259
Um, will he be okay?

578
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:30,094
The boy?

579
01:21:36,059 --> 01:21:37,059
Yeah.

580
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:02,561
He's coming back round.

581
01:23:03,438 --> 01:23:04,730
He's coming back round!

582
01:23:10,612 --> 01:23:12,529
Come on, Farrier. Come on.

583
01:23:27,754 --> 01:23:29,004
Get off the ship!

584
01:23:45,188 --> 01:23:46,647
Come on, Farrier.
Get around them.

585
01:23:46,815 --> 01:23:48,107
Come on, come on.

586
01:24:44,789 --> 01:24:45,789
Go.

587
01:24:50,295 --> 01:24:51,295
Go! Go! Go!

588
01:25:05,685 --> 01:25:06,769
Go!

589
01:25:40,553 --> 01:25:41,553
Easy.

590
01:25:46,684 --> 01:25:47,935
Take me home.

591
01:26:45,827 --> 01:26:47,119
Where are you from?

592
01:26:48,037 --> 01:26:49,830
Out of Dartmouth!

593
01:26:49,998 --> 01:26:51,248
Christ.

594
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:53,667
You from Deal?

595
01:26:53,835 --> 01:26:55,294
I am!

596
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:57,629
You watch the current at the mouth!

597
01:26:57,797 --> 01:26:58,797
Aye.

598
01:26:58,965 --> 01:27:00,048
And thank you!

599
01:27:49,849 --> 01:27:50,891
That's a fighter.

600
01:27:51,059 --> 01:27:52,225
Yes, an Me 109.

601
01:27:52,393 --> 01:27:54,072
From the south.
Peter, you take the tiller.

602
01:27:54,562 --> 01:27:56,396
Listen for my instructions.

603
01:27:57,231 --> 01:27:58,440
Point her south!

604
01:28:11,079 --> 01:28:12,079
Full speed, Peter.

605
01:28:14,499 --> 01:28:15,958
Keep coming round.

606
01:28:16,125 --> 01:28:17,334
Keep coming.

607
01:28:18,670 --> 01:28:22,339
Before he fires, he's gotta
drop his nose. I'll give you the signal.

608
01:28:23,841 --> 01:28:25,050
- Now?
- No, no. Wait.

609
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:28,303
Wait for him to commit to his line.

610
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:46,571
Now!

611
01:29:24,777 --> 01:29:25,777
He's gone.

612
01:29:25,903 --> 01:29:27,237
Yeah, bigger fish to fry.

613
01:29:27,405 --> 01:29:29,281
How'd you know that stuff, anyway?

614
01:29:29,699 --> 01:29:30,907
My son's one of you lot.

615
01:29:31,701 --> 01:29:33,410
I knew he'd see us through.

616
01:29:39,459 --> 01:29:40,459
You're RAF?

617
01:29:42,503 --> 01:29:44,379
No. Not me.

618
01:29:44,547 --> 01:29:47,883
My brother. He flew Hurricanes.

619
01:29:48,051 --> 01:29:49,634
Died third week into the war.

620
01:30:29,884 --> 01:30:31,968
No, stay downstairs, please.

621
01:30:32,595 --> 01:30:34,596
We just wanna see the cliffs.

622
01:30:41,521 --> 01:30:43,438
- Is it Dover?
- No.

623
01:30:44,023 --> 01:30:45,440
That's Dorset.

624
01:30:46,025 --> 01:30:47,567
But it's home.

625
01:30:49,570 --> 01:30:52,030
We let you all down, didn't we?

626
01:31:31,362 --> 01:31:34,239
Christ, how many you got in there?

627
01:31:52,258 --> 01:31:53,884
Make your way to the trains.

628
01:31:55,553 --> 01:31:57,137
Where the hell were you?

629
01:32:04,562 --> 01:32:06,271
They know where you were.

630
01:32:11,527 --> 01:32:12,527
Bye.

631
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:33,715
Cup of tea?

632
01:32:35,635 --> 01:32:37,010
Cup of tea?

633
01:32:37,845 --> 01:32:40,597
Well done. Well done.

634
01:32:41,015 --> 01:32:42,140
Well done, lads.

635
01:32:42,308 --> 01:32:44,935
Well done. Well done, lads.

636
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:47,604
Well done.

637
01:32:48,189 --> 01:32:49,856
All we did is survive.

638
01:32:50,524 --> 01:32:51,942
That's enough.

639
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:00,700
Well done.

640
01:33:01,869 --> 01:33:03,161
Well done.

641
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:16,800
That old bloke wouldn't even
look us in the eye.

642
01:33:37,154 --> 01:33:39,072
Come on, private!

643
01:33:39,991 --> 01:33:44,577
I know we're officers,
but it's us or the enemy.

644
01:33:45,663 --> 01:33:47,998
So now is not the time to be particular.

645
01:33:51,627 --> 01:33:54,254
Well, Churchill got his 30,000.

646
01:33:54,422 --> 01:33:55,714
And then some.

647
01:33:56,590 --> 01:33:58,675
Almost 300,000.

648
01:34:02,096 --> 01:34:03,346
So far.

649
01:34:04,724 --> 01:34:05,765
So far?

650
01:34:06,309 --> 01:34:07,559
I'm staying.

651
01:34:08,728 --> 01:34:10,103
For the French.

652
01:35:03,741 --> 01:35:05,116
Hey!

653
01:35:05,284 --> 01:35:06,451
Where are we?

654
01:35:06,619 --> 01:35:09,412
Siding. You'll be pulling in
in a minute.

655
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:11,039
What station?

656
01:35:11,207 --> 01:35:12,707
Woking.

657
01:35:13,334 --> 01:35:14,959
Grab me one of them papers.

658
01:35:15,211 --> 01:35:16,336
Go on!

659
01:35:30,184 --> 01:35:31,601
Can't bear it.

660
01:35:33,437 --> 01:35:34,604
You read it.

661
01:35:35,398 --> 01:35:36,398
Can't bear it?

662
01:35:37,024 --> 01:35:39,234
They'll be spitting at us
in the streets.

663
01:35:40,277 --> 01:35:43,113
If they're not locked up
waiting for the invasion.

664
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:32,120
"Wars are not won by evacuations."

665
01:36:35,916 --> 01:36:37,250
I can't look.

666
01:36:37,626 --> 01:36:39,627
"But there was a victory
inside this deliverance,

667
01:36:39,795 --> 01:36:41,629
"which should be noted.
