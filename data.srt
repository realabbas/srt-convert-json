1
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,161
English! I'm English!

2
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:41,801
It's grenadiers, mate.

3
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:56,941
<i>Make way!</i>

4
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,363
<i>Out of the way!</i>

5
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:04,032
Go, go, go!

6
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:06,325
Along the mole. All the way.

7
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:08,327
<i>The ship's about to leave.</i>

8
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,530
<i>Along the mole. All the way.
The ship's about to leave.</i>

9
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:47,635
Where's the bloody air force?

10
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:37,351
The navy's requisitioned her.

11
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:40,438
They'll be back in an hour.
My dad wants to be ready before then.

12
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:45,151
They've told us to strip her
and load those life jackets.

13
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:48,196
Some men across the Channel,
at Dunkirk, need taking off.

14
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:49,614
Some men?

15
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,886
<i>Check fuel, Fortis 1 and 2.</i>

16
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,183
70 gallons.

17
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,395
68 gallons, Fortis Leader.

18
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,732
<i>Stay down at 500 feet to leave fuel</i>

19
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:27,485
<i>for 40-minute fighting time
over Dunkirk.</i>

20
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:31,113
Understood.
Vector 128, angels point five.

21
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:34,450
<i>And keep an eye
on that gauge, even when it gets lively.</i>

22
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:36,535
<i>Save enough to get back.</i>

23
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:49,025
No French soldiers.
No French soldiers. No.

24
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:52,570
No, no French. English only.
English only past this point.

25
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:55,156
No. It's a British ship.
No, you have your own ships.

26
00:10:55,323 --> 00:10:56,907
Get back. Get back.

27
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:59,201
No, you've got your own ships.
This is a British ship.

28
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,703
No, get back.

29
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,889
Look, get the stretchers through.
There are stretchers coming.

30
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,915
Get out of the way! Out of the way!

31
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:08,044
Go, go, go.
Along the mole. All the way.

32
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,629
The ship's about to leave.
About to leave.

33
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:11,916
Along the mole. All the way.

34
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:14,258
<i>Along the mole. Along the mole.
All the way. All the way.</i>

35
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:15,509
<i>No.</i>

36
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:18,387
<i>No, English only. English only!</i>

37
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:22,433
<i>No!</i>

38
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:39,200
Ready on the stern!

39
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:40,368
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

40
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,130
Man the bowline!

41
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:54,715
Any more room?

42
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:03,933
<i>You have to get back!</i>

43
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:13,275
That's two minutes.

44
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,403
You've missed it. You've missed it.

45
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:44,682
Is that the last one?

46
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:46,267
Aye, sir.

47
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,271
Break the line.

48
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,401
Come on! Come on!

49
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,335
Dunkirk's so far.
Why can't they just load at Calais?

50
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:57,004
<i>The enemy
had something to say about it.</i>

51
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:01,717
Ah, down here we're sitting ducks.

52
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:04,553
<i>Keep 'em peeled.
They'll come out of the sun.</i>

53
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:18,359
<i>Up the line.</i>

54
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:22,404
Oi. We'll take it.

55
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,158
Drop the gangplank!

56
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:27,326
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

57
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:45,761
Take a run at it.

58
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:17,543
Ready on the stern line, George.

59
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:21,797
Aren't you waiting on the navy?

60
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,008
They've asked for the <i>Moonstone,</i>
they'll have her.

61
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,342
And her captain.

62
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,720
And his son.

63
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:31,974
<i>Thanks for the help, George.</i>

64
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,021
What are you doing?

65
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:38,387
You do know where we're going?

66
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,191
France.

67
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:44,153
Into war, George.

68
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:46,405
I'll be useful, sir.

69
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,457
Bandit, 11 o'clock.

70
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,667
<i>Break.</i>

71
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,223
He's on me.

72
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:16,894
I'm on him.

73
00:16:52,096 --> 00:16:55,057
<i>One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...</i>

74
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:56,266
<i>Oi, you two.</i>

75
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:57,810
Get a shift on.

76
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:02,356
<i>Yeah, pull him tight. Tie a knot in it.</i>

77
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:04,441
Back up the line. Both of you.

78
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:06,026
<i>Off you go.</i>

79
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,361
Off you go!

80
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:09,863
<i>That last barrage
has damaged the rudder.</i>

81
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:11,365
<i>Uh, okay...</i>

82
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:13,826
Psst!

83
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:50,779
Mr. Dawson!

84
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:52,322
One of ours, George.

85
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,645
On my mark, Fortis 2.
Draw him left.

86
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:08,607
Three, two, one.

87
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,192
<i>Mark.</i>

88
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,541
Clear.

89
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:30,671
Is he down?

90
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:40,514
Yeah, he's down for the count.

91
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,231
Fortis Leader, one bandit down.

92
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,028
Fortis Leader, do you read?

93
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:04,288
<i>Fortis 2, I have you to my port.
I have no eyes on Fortis Leader. Over.</i>

94
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,582
Understood, Fortis 1.

95
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,166
Orbit for a look.

96
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:22,139
How long, Lieutenant?

97
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:25,392
We need to run a new cable, sir.
They're scrambling.

98
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,852
Very well.

99
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:34,568
Colonel, you're gonna have to decide
how many more wounded to evacuate.

100
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:37,321
One stretcher takes the space
of seven standing men.

101
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:38,572
Excuse me.

102
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:54,713
<i>- Rear Admiral.
- Commander.</i>

103
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:58,675
How's the perimeter?

104
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,344
Shrinking every day.

105
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:03,597
But between our rear guard
and the French, we're holding the line.

106
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:05,933
And the enemy tanks have stopped.

107
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,476
Why have they stopped?

108
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,186
Waste precious tanks

109
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,247
<i>when they can pick us off from the air,
like fish in a barrel?</i>

110
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:14,316
How long does London expect the army
to hold out before we make terms?

111
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:15,484
Make terms?

112
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:19,488
They're not stopping here.
We need to get our army back.

113
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:22,783
Britain's next
and then the rest of the world.

114
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,034
Christ.

115
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:27,371
I mean, you can practically see it
from here.

116
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:28,664
What?

117
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:30,832
Home.

118
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,543
What about the French?

119
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,046
Publicly, Churchill's told them,
<i>"Bras dessous."</i>

120
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:38,215
Arm in arm, leaving together.

121
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:39,633
<i>And privately?</i>

122
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,301
We need our army back.

123
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:43,929
How many men
are they talking about, sir?

124
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,433
Churchill wants 30,000.
Ramsay's hoping we can give him 45.

125
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,270
There are 400,000 men
on this beach, sir.

126
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,357
<i>We'll just have to do our best.</i>

127
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:59,069
Right, well, this mole stays open
at all costs.

128
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:04,241
We're in artillery range from the west.
If anything else sinks here,

129
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,410
the mole's blocked and we're stuffed.

130
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:08,120
Can't we load from the beaches?

131
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:09,973
Better than standing out here
when the dive bombs come.

132
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:11,373
- It's impossible.
- Too shallow?

133
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,559
'Cause anything that drafts
over three feet can't get near.

134
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,670
We don't have enough small boats
to ferry men to the destroyers.

135
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:20,090
The mole it is, then, gentlemen.

136
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:10,599
Hey!

137
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,727
Hey! Can you swim it?

138
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:16,938
Dad, can you get closer?

139
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:19,149
Can't risk it!

140
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:21,735
Hang on.

141
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:12,577
What's your name?

142
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:33,098
Wreckage below.

143
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:36,059
<i>Is it more of the 109?</i>

144
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:37,394
No.

145
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:39,354
It's Fortis Leader. Over.

146
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:41,857
<i>You think he got out?</i>

147
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:43,066
I didn't see a 'chute.

148
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,820
<i>Record his position.</i>

149
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:49,197
<i>Then set heading 128,</i>

150
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:51,241
<i>height 1,000. Over.</i>

151
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,493
Vector 128, angels one. Understood.

152
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:00,876
Fortis 2, what's your fuel?

153
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:03,378
50 gallons. Over.

154
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:06,214
50 gallons.

155
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:11,761
All right, keep letting me know.

156
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:13,722
My gauge took a bit of a knock
back there.

157
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:16,808
<i>Shouldn't you turn back?</i>

158
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:18,476
No, no.

159
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,479
I'm fairly confident
it's just the gauge.

160
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:52,737
<i>- She's going down!</i>
- Cut her loose!

161
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:53,989
What about the wounded?

162
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:57,659
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

163
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,496
Cut her loose, and push her off!

164
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,415
We can't let her sink at the mole!

165
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:05,959
<i>Push the bloody boat off!</i>

166
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:14,426
Help us!

167
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:29,626
Do you want to come below?

168
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:31,711
It's much warmer.

169
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:33,797
It's out of the wind.

170
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:35,382
Here you go.

171
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:39,677
Leave him be, George.

172
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:41,679
He feels safer on deck.

173
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:44,265
You would too if you'd been bombed.

174
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:45,433
<i>U-boat.</i>

175
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,938
It was a U-boat.

176
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:55,151
Get him some more tea, George.

177
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,460
Right,
we're about five minutes out,

178
00:29:12,627 --> 00:29:14,295
so climb to 2,000. Over.

179
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:15,588
That's more fuel.

180
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:17,441
<i>I know, but I don't want
to get jumped again.</i>

181
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:18,585
Let's get a decent altitude.

182
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:20,593
We can dive down on the bastards
from above. Over.

183
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:22,220
<i>Understood. Angels two.</i>

184
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:23,388
<i>Over.</i>

185
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:26,891
Right, Highlanders.

186
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,018
<i>Let's find you another ship.</i>

187
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:42,133
<i>Come on.</i>

188
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:47,722
<i>Everyone else, keep climbing.
Climb on the deck.</i>

189
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:51,017
<i>Climb on the deck.</i>

190
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:53,561
Watch your heads on the rail.
Watch it.

191
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:57,106
<i>That's right, keep going down.
Take a blanket.</i>

192
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:58,593
Down you go.
Put this on, my love.

193
00:30:59,192 --> 00:31:02,070
Down you go. Keep going down.

194
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:04,364
There's a nice cup of tea
for you down there.

195
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:05,532
Keep moving down.

196
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:07,367
<i>Take a blanket.</i>

197
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:09,577
<i>Try and make some room.</i>

198
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:11,162
<i>Keep moving down, boys.</i>

199
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:13,581
<i>This way.</i>

200
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:16,292
<i>A cup of tea down there.</i>

201
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:43,987
<i>There you go. Down there.
Move down there.</i>

202
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:04,674
What's wrong with your friend?

203
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:25,347
He's looking for a quick way out.

204
00:32:27,697 --> 00:32:29,115
In case we go down.

205
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:09,072
Where are we going?

206
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:10,740
Dunkirk.

207
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:14,869
No, uh, no, no,
we're going to England.

208
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:18,581
We have to go to Dunkirk first.

209
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:21,918
Look, I'm not going back.

210
00:33:23,336 --> 00:33:24,879
I'm not going back.

211
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:27,131
Look at it.

212
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:30,009
If we go there, we'll die.

213
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:38,184
I see your point, son.

214
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,145
Well, let's plot a course.

215
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:47,151
<i>You can take your tea below
and warm up.</i>

216
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:52,323
Peter, have we got space
for a man to lie down?

217
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:53,866
Uh, yeah.

218
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:00,665
Here, come on.

219
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:07,046
<i>Careful.</i>

220
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:10,633
Careful.

221
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:18,266
<i>Just in there.</i>

222
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,476
I'll get you some more tea.

223
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:38,786
Is he a coward, Mr. Dawson?

224
00:34:38,953 --> 00:34:40,580
He's shell-shocked, George.

225
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:42,331
He's not himself.

226
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:47,462
He may never be himself again.

227
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:57,221
Here you are.

228
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:16,699
40 gallons, Fortis 1.

229
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:19,368
40 gallons, understood.

230
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:24,999
Heinkel, 11 o'clock.

231
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:28,336
She's lining up to drop her load
on that minesweeper.

232
00:35:28,503 --> 00:35:29,504
Fighters?

233
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,131
Yeah, 109s off her starboard.

234
00:35:33,216 --> 00:35:34,675
I'm on the bomber.

235
00:36:26,477 --> 00:36:27,478
Got him! Got him!

236
00:36:59,844 --> 00:37:01,637
Oh, she's turning.
You must've damaged her.

237
00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:03,222
Where's the escort?

238
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:04,557
Well, I got one of—

239
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:06,225
Jesus!

240
00:37:25,036 --> 00:37:26,287
I'm going down.

241
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:27,997
I'm on him. Bail out.

242
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:49,744
No, the swell looks good. I'm ditching.

243
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:11,832
<i>Don't leave us!</i>

244
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,335
Come back!

245
00:38:14,877 --> 00:38:17,380
- Wait for us!
- Help! Help us!

246
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:23,636
<i>Pick us up! Pick us up!</i>

247
00:38:27,348 --> 00:38:28,808
<i>Come back!</i>

248
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,769
Torpedo!

249
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:07,013
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

250
00:40:53,536 --> 00:40:54,745
<i>Help!</i>

251
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:56,580
<i>Get us out of here!</i>

252
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:12,596
<i>Spitfires, George.</i>

253
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:15,099
Greatest plane ever built.

254
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:19,937
<i>You didn't even look.</i>

255
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:23,274
Rolls-Royce Merlin engines.

256
00:41:24,108 --> 00:41:27,319
Sweetest sound you could hear out here.

257
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:29,113
<i>Hello?</i>

258
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:32,783
<i>Could you open the door?</i>

259
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,493
<i>Hello? Can you hear me?</i>

260
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:38,330
<i>Open the door!</i>

261
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:40,124
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

262
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:43,752
He wants to come out.

263
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:45,921
What have you done? Locked him in?

264
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:47,590
Let him out, for God's sake.

265
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:48,757
<i>Hello?</i>

266
00:41:50,718 --> 00:41:52,386
<i>Let me out!</i>

267
00:42:06,901 --> 00:42:09,361
<i>You haven't turned around.</i>

268
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:13,741
No. We have a job to do.

269
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:18,287
Job?
This is a pleasure yacht.

270
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:21,248
You're weekend sailors,
not the bloody navy.

271
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:23,542
<i>A man your age?</i>

272
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:26,462
Men my age dictate this war.

273
00:42:26,629 --> 00:42:29,340
Why should we be allowed
to send our children to fight it?

274
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:31,258
You should be at home!

275
00:42:31,342 --> 00:42:35,012
Well, there won't be any home if we
allow a slaughter across the Channel.

276
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:43,741
He's turning tail.
I'm gonna get after him.

277
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:46,690
<i>Good luck.</i>

278
00:42:46,857 --> 00:42:49,860
Watch your fuel. You're at 15 gallons.

279
00:42:52,488 --> 00:42:53,948
15 gallons, understood.

280
00:42:56,033 --> 00:42:57,618
Best of luck, Collins.

281
00:43:00,663 --> 00:43:02,831
Collins, do you read?

282
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:06,812
Oi! No! No!

283
00:44:06,979 --> 00:44:08,689
Get off! Get off!

284
00:44:09,231 --> 00:44:11,066
Piss off, the both of you.
It's too crowded.

285
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:12,484
<i>You can't leave us!</i>

286
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:14,611
<i>Make some room!</i>

287
00:44:14,778 --> 00:44:15,779
No!

288
00:44:16,697 --> 00:44:17,990
No! Get off!

289
00:44:18,157 --> 00:44:19,676
You men, leave off.
You'll capsize the boat.

290
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,869
She's gone over twice
on the way out here.

291
00:44:22,036 --> 00:44:23,805
You have to stay calm.
There are plenty of boats.

292
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:24,830
<i>Calm?</i>

293
00:44:24,997 --> 00:44:27,249
Wait till you get torpedoed,
then tell us to be calm!

294
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:29,084
You have life jackets?

295
00:44:29,251 --> 00:44:30,586
<i>Yes, they do.</i>

296
00:44:30,753 --> 00:44:32,713
Don't panic, boys.
The water's not too rough

297
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,964
<i>or too cold.</i>

298
00:44:34,131 --> 00:44:35,674
<i>We're heading back to the beach.</i>

299
00:44:35,841 --> 00:44:38,093
- Let's go to Dover!
- Yeah!

300
00:44:38,844 --> 00:44:40,655
We can't make it across the Channel
in this, lads.

301
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:44,141
We need to get back to the beach
and wait for another ride.

302
00:44:44,475 --> 00:44:47,269
<i>You men in the water, float here,
save your strength.</i>

303
00:44:47,436 --> 00:44:48,979
<i>We'll come back for you.</i>

304
00:44:49,146 --> 00:44:50,147
<i>Oars in!</i>

305
00:44:51,273 --> 00:44:53,984
Together, pull!

306
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:57,529
<i>Together, pull!</i>

307
00:44:59,865 --> 00:45:00,866
Pull!

308
00:45:01,909 --> 00:45:04,078
Together, pull!

309
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:07,331
Pull!

310
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:11,377
<i>Together, pull!</i>

311
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,799
There's no hiding from this, son.

312
00:45:19,093 --> 00:45:21,762
What is it you think you can do
out there, on this thing?

313
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:25,099
There's not just us. A call went out.

314
00:45:25,265 --> 00:45:27,309
<i>We aren't the only ones
to answer, you know.</i>

315
00:45:27,476 --> 00:45:29,144
You don't even have guns.

316
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,521
Do you have a gun?

317
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:33,440
Yes, of course. A rifle, a 303.

318
00:45:33,607 --> 00:45:36,652
Did it help you against the dive bombers
and the U-boats?

319
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:39,530
You're an old fool.

320
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:42,574
I'm not going back.

321
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:44,410
I'm not going back.

322
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,120
Turn it around.

323
00:45:47,204 --> 00:45:48,622
I'm not turning round.

324
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:50,457
Turn it around!

325
00:45:52,209 --> 00:45:53,419
Turn it—

326
00:45:55,421 --> 00:45:56,941
- Calm it down, mate.
- Turn it around!

327
00:45:57,047 --> 00:45:58,048
Wait, wait!

328
00:45:58,215 --> 00:45:59,633
Calm it down, mate.

329
00:46:01,093 --> 00:46:02,094
<i>George?</i>

330
00:46:02,928 --> 00:46:03,929
George!

331
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:07,724
What have you done?

332
00:46:09,435 --> 00:46:10,894
Okay, you're all right, George.

333
00:46:11,645 --> 00:46:12,813
<i>You're all right.</i>

334
00:46:13,522 --> 00:46:16,525
Hang on. Okay. Okay, just...

335
00:46:16,692 --> 00:46:18,193
That's it. That's good enough.

336
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,280
It's gonna keep some pressure on.
There we go.

337
00:46:21,447 --> 00:46:23,031
There we go.

338
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:24,450
Can you hear me, George?

339
00:48:59,021 --> 00:49:00,480
Come on, lads!

340
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:04,610
Come on! Come on, boys!

341
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:11,278
It's a pier.

342
00:51:12,362 --> 00:51:13,947
For when the water comes in.

343
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:19,870
The tide's turning now.

344
00:51:21,955 --> 00:51:22,956
How can you tell?

345
00:51:25,417 --> 00:51:26,877
The bodies come back.

346
00:51:57,699 --> 00:51:58,700
Hey.

347
00:52:11,046 --> 00:52:12,714
Hey, Highlanders!

348
00:52:22,641 --> 00:52:24,309
Hey, Highlanders!

349
00:52:24,476 --> 00:52:25,685
What's that way?

350
00:52:26,311 --> 00:52:27,354
A boat.

351
00:52:27,521 --> 00:52:28,897
She's grounded.

352
00:52:29,064 --> 00:52:31,149
Not when the tide comes in, she's not.

353
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:51,044
Be a brave lad.

354
00:52:53,588 --> 00:52:55,048
<i>You and Mr. Dawson?</i>

355
00:52:57,133 --> 00:52:58,533
<i>It's the best thing I've ever done.</i>

356
00:52:59,302 --> 00:53:01,721
You're all right. You're okay.

357
00:53:12,774 --> 00:53:15,277
<i>Sea Cadet.
It's the only thing I've ever done.</i>

358
00:53:15,443 --> 00:53:17,612
It's all right. It's okay.
Just have some water.

359
00:53:20,448 --> 00:53:22,117
<i>I told my dad...</i>

360
00:53:22,284 --> 00:53:24,452
I've done nothing at school

361
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:28,540
and that I would do something one day.

362
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:33,795
Maybe get in the local paper.

363
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:36,256
<i>Maybe my teachers would see it.</i>

364
00:53:36,423 --> 00:53:37,966
Okay, get some rest.

365
00:53:38,633 --> 00:53:41,136
I need you back up on deck
as soon as you're able.

366
00:53:42,429 --> 00:53:43,430
I can't.

367
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:45,682
What?

368
00:53:49,603 --> 00:53:50,937
I can't see.

369
00:54:50,872 --> 00:54:51,873
<i>Sir.</i>

370
00:54:53,208 --> 00:54:55,669
The French have been forced back
on the western side.

371
00:54:56,586 --> 00:54:57,946
They're still holding a perimeter?

372
00:54:58,088 --> 00:54:59,089
For now.

373
00:55:00,674 --> 00:55:02,914
Officer coming through.
Move yourselves. Move yourselves!

374
00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:15,063
Where are the destroyers?

375
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:16,773
There'll be one soon.

376
00:55:19,901 --> 00:55:20,902
One?

377
00:55:21,027 --> 00:55:23,613
After yesterday's losses,
it's one ship on the mole at a time.

378
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:24,864
The battle is here.

379
00:55:25,031 --> 00:55:26,591
What the hell are they saving them for?

380
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,159
The next battle.

381
00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:29,786
The one for Britain.

382
00:55:29,953 --> 00:55:31,913
It's the same with the planes.

383
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,667
But it's right there.

384
00:55:36,376 --> 00:55:37,377
You can practically—

385
00:55:37,544 --> 00:55:39,587
Seeing home doesn't help us
get there, Colonel.

386
00:55:39,754 --> 00:55:41,715
They need to send more ships.

387
00:55:42,632 --> 00:55:44,217
Every hour the enemy pushes closer.

388
00:55:45,051 --> 00:55:47,053
They've activated
the small vessels pool.

389
00:55:48,013 --> 00:55:49,014
Small vessels?

390
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:51,641
It's the list of civilian boats
for requisition.

391
00:55:52,142 --> 00:55:53,143
Civilian?

392
00:55:54,978 --> 00:55:56,730
We need destroyers.

393
00:55:56,896 --> 00:55:58,648
Small boats can load from the beach.

394
00:55:58,815 --> 00:56:00,066
Not in these conditions.

395
00:56:00,233 --> 00:56:02,736
Well, I'd rather face waves
than dive bombers.

396
00:56:05,697 --> 00:56:08,450
No, you're right.
They won't get up in this.

397
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:12,579
The Royal Engineers are building piers
from lorries.

398
00:56:12,746 --> 00:56:15,373
At least that should help us
when the tide comes back.

399
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,709
Well, we'll know in six hours' time.

400
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:20,190
I thought the tides were every three?

401
00:56:21,963 --> 00:56:24,758
Then it's good that you're army
and I'm navy, isn't it?

402
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:28,511
There. <i>Vanquisher.</i>

403
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:44,527
Where's the crew?

404
00:56:44,694 --> 00:56:46,571
Probably got spooked
after they ran aground.

405
00:56:47,363 --> 00:56:48,907
Scarpered up the beach.

406
00:56:49,365 --> 00:56:50,366
Why?

407
00:56:50,533 --> 00:56:53,745
'Cause we're outside the perimeter.
Enemy could be right there.

408
00:56:54,913 --> 00:56:57,332
<i>All right,
best shut ourselves inside, boys.</i>

409
00:56:57,499 --> 00:56:58,500
Wait for the high tide.

410
00:56:58,666 --> 00:57:00,251
How long's that?

411
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:02,045
Every three hours.

412
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:27,695
I've put a bit of pressure on it.

413
00:57:27,862 --> 00:57:29,823
Strapped him up, made him comfortable.

414
00:57:31,074 --> 00:57:32,075
What?

415
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:35,411
It's bad, Dad.

416
00:57:38,414 --> 00:57:39,916
Well, should we turn back?

417
00:57:46,297 --> 00:57:47,298
We've come so far.

418
00:57:48,675 --> 00:57:50,176
Dad, is that one of ours?

419
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:55,014
That's a Heinkel.
They'll go for that minesweeper there.

420
00:57:55,515 --> 00:57:57,451
Hang on. Shouldn't we stand by
to pick up survivors?

421
00:57:57,475 --> 00:57:59,352
To do that we have to survive ourselves.

422
00:58:04,107 --> 00:58:06,276
Poke your head out.
See if the water's come in.

423
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:13,241
Talkative sod, aren't you?

424
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:41,144
It's barely come in at all.

425
00:58:41,311 --> 00:58:43,479
- Fuck's sake.
- Calm down.

426
00:58:43,646 --> 00:58:45,815
What goes out
comes back in again, right?

427
00:58:45,982 --> 00:58:47,400
Yeah, but how long?

428
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,001
<i>Spitfires!</i>

429
00:59:05,877 --> 00:59:06,920
Come on.

430
00:59:13,551 --> 00:59:14,594
Come on, come on.

431
00:59:23,353 --> 00:59:24,687
Dad, he got him!

432
00:59:24,854 --> 00:59:26,439
Yeah! Yeah!

433
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,323
The Heinkel's moving off.

434
00:59:40,453 --> 00:59:41,454
Yeah.

435
00:59:43,081 --> 00:59:44,082
Oh, no.

436
00:59:46,042 --> 00:59:47,835
Smoke from the Spitfire!

437
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:51,005
Watch for a parachute!

438
00:59:57,845 --> 00:59:58,846
Oi.

439
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:05,520
<i>Oi. Oi.</i>

440
01:00:51,566 --> 01:00:52,900
Are you German?

441
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:54,402
No, Dutch. Dutch!

442
01:00:55,778 --> 01:00:56,779
<i>Merchant navy.</i>

443
01:00:57,613 --> 01:00:59,115
Here to pick you up. To help you.

444
01:00:59,282 --> 01:01:00,950
Why'd you leave your boat?

445
01:01:01,117 --> 01:01:02,368
In case the Germans come.

446
01:01:02,994 --> 01:01:05,079
<i>We wait up the beach.</i>

447
01:01:05,246 --> 01:01:06,873
With the soldiers.
Wait for the tide.

448
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,334
You came back. The tide must be in.

449
01:01:10,501 --> 01:01:12,211
Coming. Coming, yes.

450
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,547
But more hours till we float.

451
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:15,840
Hours?

452
01:01:16,007 --> 01:01:17,467
Why'd you come back?

453
01:01:19,385 --> 01:01:20,553
Not so heavy when I left.

454
01:01:33,816 --> 01:01:35,401
No 'chute!

455
01:01:40,448 --> 01:01:41,449
<i>Best of luck, Collins.</i>

456
01:01:46,996 --> 01:01:48,873
<i>Collins, do you read?</i>

457
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:16,025
He's down.

458
01:02:59,152 --> 01:03:00,153
Dad.

459
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:01,529
Dad, watch the engine.

460
01:03:02,405 --> 01:03:04,866
<i>Dad, he's down.
There was no 'chute.</i>

461
01:03:09,162 --> 01:03:10,496
Dad, come on.
There was no 'chute.

462
01:03:11,497 --> 01:03:12,498
<i>He's probably dead.</i>

463
01:03:12,665 --> 01:03:14,834
Damn it, I hear you, Peter!
I hear you!

464
01:03:18,171 --> 01:03:19,881
He may be alive. Maybe.

465
01:03:21,924 --> 01:03:23,759
We may be able to help him.

466
01:04:17,355 --> 01:04:19,607
No! Then they'll know we're in here.

467
01:04:19,774 --> 01:04:21,275
Why else are they shooting at us?

468
01:04:21,776 --> 01:04:23,319
Look at the grouping.

469
01:04:27,156 --> 01:04:28,616
Target practice.

470
01:05:29,844 --> 01:05:33,264
Go. Plug it. Go, go.

471
01:05:53,492 --> 01:05:54,785
We have to plug it.

472
01:05:54,952 --> 01:05:56,621
After you, mate.

473
01:06:18,684 --> 01:06:20,186
You ready? Go!

474
01:06:24,857 --> 01:06:27,360
How do we get off?
Do we need to ditch some ballast?

475
01:06:27,777 --> 01:06:29,570
<i>Weight! Do we need to lose weight?</i>

476
01:06:29,737 --> 01:06:31,489
Weight. Weight, yes.

477
01:06:31,656 --> 01:06:32,990
Yes.

478
01:06:33,157 --> 01:06:34,533
Somebody needs to get off.

479
01:06:35,576 --> 01:06:36,994
Well volunteered.

480
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:38,704
We don't need a volunteer.

481
01:06:39,163 --> 01:06:40,790
I know someone who ought to get off.

482
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:44,251
This one.

483
01:06:45,586 --> 01:06:46,879
He's a German spy.

484
01:06:47,046 --> 01:06:48,422
Don't be daft.

485
01:06:48,589 --> 01:06:50,132
He's a fucking Jerry.

486
01:06:51,008 --> 01:06:53,094
Have you noticed he hasn't said a word?

487
01:06:54,804 --> 01:06:55,971
<i>'Cause I have.</i>

488
01:06:56,847 --> 01:06:57,848
He don't speak English.

489
01:06:58,015 --> 01:07:01,185
<i>If he does it's with an accent
that's thicker than sauerkraut sauce.</i>

490
01:07:01,352 --> 01:07:03,062
You're daft. Tell him.

491
01:07:03,604 --> 01:07:04,814
<i>Yeah.</i>

492
01:07:08,192 --> 01:07:10,611
Tell me.

493
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:36,971
Tell me, Gibson.

494
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:46,021
Tell me!

495
01:07:47,106 --> 01:07:48,607
Tell him, for God's sake!

496
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:59,076
<i>A frog.</i>

497
01:07:59,535 --> 01:08:01,078
A bloody frog.

498
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:04,915
A cowardly little queue-jumping frog.

499
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:06,959
Who's Gibson, eh?

500
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:09,587
Some naked, dead Englishman
lying out on that sand?

501
01:08:09,754 --> 01:08:11,797
Did you at least have the decency
to bury him?

502
01:08:12,006 --> 01:08:13,886
<i>He did. I helped him.
I thought it was his mate.</i>

503
01:08:13,966 --> 01:08:15,360
<i>- Maybe he killed him.</i>
- He didn't kill him.

504
01:08:15,384 --> 01:08:16,385
How do we know?

505
01:08:16,552 --> 01:08:18,971
How hard is it to find a dead Englishman
on Dunkirk beach?

506
01:08:19,138 --> 01:08:20,389
He didn't kill anyone.

507
01:08:20,556 --> 01:08:23,076
He was just looking for a way
off the sand, like the rest of us.

508
01:08:28,147 --> 01:08:29,857
Haven't they had enough practice
by now?

509
01:08:30,024 --> 01:08:32,026
They're trying to make sure
she won't float.

510
01:08:32,193 --> 01:08:33,694
Will she still float?

511
01:08:33,861 --> 01:08:35,654
Float, yes. Yes, with less weight.

512
01:08:37,323 --> 01:08:38,508
And we know who's getting off.

513
01:08:38,532 --> 01:08:40,659
No, you can't do that.
He's French. He's on our side.

514
01:08:40,826 --> 01:08:42,328
Go on. Up you go.

515
01:08:42,495 --> 01:08:44,747
As soon as he pokes his head out,
they'll slaughter him.

516
01:08:44,914 --> 01:08:46,165
Better him than me.

517
01:08:46,332 --> 01:08:47,500
It's not fair.

518
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:48,959
Survival's not fair.

519
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:50,127
<i>No, it's shit.</i>

520
01:08:51,003 --> 01:08:53,339
It's fear, and it's greed.

521
01:08:53,506 --> 01:08:55,508
Fate pushed through the bowels of men.

522
01:08:55,674 --> 01:08:56,675
Shit.

523
01:08:58,177 --> 01:08:59,428
He saved our lives.

524
01:08:59,595 --> 01:09:00,846
And he's about to do it again.

525
01:09:01,013 --> 01:09:02,056
No, don't! Stop!

526
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:06,769
Somebody's gotta get off,
so the rest of us can live.

527
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,562
If you wanna volunteer—

528
01:09:08,729 --> 01:09:09,897
Fuck no.

529
01:09:10,147 --> 01:09:11,148
I'm going home.

530
01:09:11,857 --> 01:09:13,484
And if this is the price?

531
01:09:18,447 --> 01:09:19,615
I'll live with it.

532
01:09:20,241 --> 01:09:21,242
But it's wrong.

533
01:09:22,034 --> 01:09:23,035
Go on!

534
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,122
One man's not going to make
enough difference.

535
01:09:27,289 --> 01:09:29,649
You'd best hope it does,
because you'd be volunteering next.

536
01:09:30,543 --> 01:09:31,544
What?

537
01:09:32,378 --> 01:09:34,296
We're regimental brothers, mate.

538
01:09:34,922 --> 01:09:36,298
It's just the way it is.

539
01:09:46,308 --> 01:09:47,685
<i>We float!</i>

540
01:09:48,394 --> 01:09:49,520
We float!

541
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:51,814
Start the bloody engine!

542
01:10:30,185 --> 01:10:31,604
Afternoon.

543
01:11:26,951 --> 01:11:29,328
I'm sorry, son. I really don't know.

544
01:11:31,997 --> 01:11:33,749
You're right not moving him.

545
01:11:37,336 --> 01:11:38,837
You've done the best for him you can.

546
01:11:50,933 --> 01:11:52,101
<i>We've wasted the day.</i>

547
01:11:52,267 --> 01:11:54,311
I share your frustration, Colonel.

548
01:11:55,854 --> 01:11:56,855
Johnny!

549
01:12:03,821 --> 01:12:05,739
Grounded trawler, taking fire.

550
01:12:05,906 --> 01:12:07,950
They're breaking through the dunes
to the east.

551
01:12:11,745 --> 01:12:13,163
This is it.

552
01:12:21,255 --> 01:12:22,339
Plug the holes!

553
01:12:22,506 --> 01:12:23,799
With what?

554
01:12:34,727 --> 01:12:36,603
<i>Plug the holes!</i>

555
01:12:38,355 --> 01:12:41,150
Other side! Other side!

556
01:13:30,949 --> 01:13:32,409
What do you see?

557
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:40,626
Home.

558
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:37,201
Is he all right? The boy?

559
01:15:39,203 --> 01:15:40,454
No.

560
01:15:40,621 --> 01:15:42,289
No, he's not.

561
01:15:53,717 --> 01:15:54,718
<i>Dad!</i>

562
01:16:02,601 --> 01:16:04,895
Come on. Come on, Farrier. Come on.

563
01:16:23,872 --> 01:16:25,457
There's men in the water!

564
01:17:10,794 --> 01:17:11,795
<i>Oil.</i>

565
01:17:13,255 --> 01:17:15,757
It's oil. Oil. You're getting into oil!

566
01:17:51,209 --> 01:17:52,669
<i>Keep coming.</i>

567
01:17:53,587 --> 01:17:55,005
<i>Plenty of room.</i>

568
01:18:00,052 --> 01:18:01,845
All right, below deck.

569
01:18:37,923 --> 01:18:39,800
Abandon ship!

570
01:19:02,072 --> 01:19:04,366
Gibson! Leave it!

571
01:19:47,367 --> 01:19:48,535
Below decks.

572
01:20:37,459 --> 01:20:39,659
<i>Listen, we have to get
as many of you on board as we can</i>

573
01:20:39,794 --> 01:20:40,954
before that oil catches fire.

574
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:43,715
You go below decks or you get
off my boat. That's your choice.

575
01:20:46,635 --> 01:20:48,386
Keep coming.

576
01:20:49,721 --> 01:20:52,224
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Careful! Careful down there!

577
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:53,683
Careful! Careful down there!

578
01:20:55,727 --> 01:20:57,854
He's dead, mate.

579
01:21:02,442 --> 01:21:04,569
So be bloody careful with him.

580
01:21:26,591 --> 01:21:28,260
Um, will he be okay?

581
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:30,095
The boy?

582
01:21:36,059 --> 01:21:37,060
Yeah.

583
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:02,562
He's coming back round.

584
01:23:03,438 --> 01:23:04,731
He's coming back round!

585
01:23:10,612 --> 01:23:12,530
Come on, Farrier. Come on.

586
01:23:27,754 --> 01:23:29,005
<i>Get off the ship!</i>

587
01:23:45,188 --> 01:23:46,648
Come on, Farrier.
Get around them.

588
01:23:46,815 --> 01:23:48,108
Come on, come on.

589
01:24:44,789 --> 01:24:45,790
Go.

590
01:24:50,295 --> 01:24:51,296
Go! Go! Go!

591
01:25:05,685 --> 01:25:06,770
Go!

592
01:25:40,553 --> 01:25:41,554
Easy.

593
01:25:46,684 --> 01:25:47,936
Take me home.

594
01:26:45,827 --> 01:26:47,120
Where are you from?

595
01:26:48,037 --> 01:26:49,831
Out of Dartmouth!

596
01:26:49,998 --> 01:26:51,249
Christ.

597
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:53,668
You from Deal?

598
01:26:53,835 --> 01:26:55,295
I am!

599
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:57,630
You watch the current at the mouth!

600
01:26:57,797 --> 01:26:58,798
Aye.

601
01:26:58,965 --> 01:27:00,049
And thank you!

602
01:27:49,849 --> 01:27:50,892
That's a fighter.

603
01:27:51,059 --> 01:27:52,226
Yes, an Me 109.

604
01:27:52,393 --> 01:27:54,073
<i>From the south.
Peter, you take the tiller.</i>

605
01:27:54,562 --> 01:27:56,397
Listen for my instructions.

606
01:27:57,231 --> 01:27:58,441
Point her south!

607
01:28:11,079 --> 01:28:12,080
Full speed, Peter.

608
01:28:14,499 --> 01:28:15,959
Keep coming round.

609
01:28:16,125 --> 01:28:17,335
<i>Keep coming.</i>

610
01:28:18,670 --> 01:28:22,340
Before he fires, he's gotta
drop his nose. I'll give you the signal.

611
01:28:23,841 --> 01:28:25,051
- Now?
- No, no. Wait.

612
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:28,304
Wait for him to commit to his line.

613
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:46,572
Now!

614
01:29:24,777 --> 01:29:25,778
<i>He's gone.</i>

615
01:29:25,903 --> 01:29:27,238
Yeah, bigger fish to fry.

616
01:29:27,405 --> 01:29:29,282
How'd you know that stuff, anyway?

617
01:29:29,699 --> 01:29:30,908
My son's one of you lot.

618
01:29:31,701 --> 01:29:33,411
I knew he'd see us through.

619
01:29:39,459 --> 01:29:40,460
You're RAF?

620
01:29:42,503 --> 01:29:44,380
No. Not me.

621
01:29:44,547 --> 01:29:47,884
My brother. He flew Hurricanes.

622
01:29:48,051 --> 01:29:49,635
Died third week into the war.

623
01:30:29,884 --> 01:30:31,969
No, stay downstairs, please.

624
01:30:32,595 --> 01:30:34,597
We just wanna see the cliffs.

625
01:30:41,521 --> 01:30:43,439
<i>- Is it Dover?
- No.</i>

626
01:30:44,023 --> 01:30:45,441
That's Dorset.

627
01:30:46,025 --> 01:30:47,568
<i>But it's home.</i>

628
01:30:49,570 --> 01:30:52,031
We let you all down, didn't we?

629
01:31:31,362 --> 01:31:34,240
Christ, how many you got in there?

630
01:31:52,258 --> 01:31:53,885
<i>Make your way to the trains.</i>

631
01:31:55,553 --> 01:31:57,138
<i>Where the hell were you?</i>

632
01:32:04,562 --> 01:32:06,272
They know where you were.

633
01:32:11,527 --> 01:32:12,528
Bye.

634
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:33,716
<i>Cup of tea?</i>

635
01:32:35,635 --> 01:32:37,011
<i>Cup of tea?</i>

636
01:32:37,845 --> 01:32:40,598
Well done. Well done.

637
01:32:41,015 --> 01:32:42,141
Well done, lads.

638
01:32:42,308 --> 01:32:44,936
Well done. Well done, lads.

639
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:47,605
Well done.

640
01:32:48,189 --> 01:32:49,857
All we did is survive.

641
01:32:50,524 --> 01:32:51,943
That's enough.

642
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:00,701
Well done.

643
01:33:01,869 --> 01:33:03,162
Well done.

644
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:16,801
That old bloke wouldn't even
look us in the eye.

645
01:33:37,154 --> 01:33:39,073
<i>Come on, private!</i>

646
01:33:39,991 --> 01:33:44,578
I know we're officers,
but it's us or the enemy.

647
01:33:45,663 --> 01:33:47,999
So now is not the time to be particular.

648
01:33:51,627 --> 01:33:54,255
Well, Churchill got his 30,000.

649
01:33:54,422 --> 01:33:55,715
And then some.

650
01:33:56,590 --> 01:33:58,676
Almost 300,000.

651
01:34:02,096 --> 01:34:03,347
So far.

652
01:34:04,724 --> 01:34:05,766
So far?

653
01:34:06,309 --> 01:34:07,560
I'm staying.

654
01:34:08,728 --> 01:34:10,104
For the French.

655
01:35:03,741 --> 01:35:05,117
Hey!

656
01:35:05,284 --> 01:35:06,452
Where are we?

657
01:35:06,619 --> 01:35:09,413
Siding. You'll be pulling in
in a minute.

658
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:11,040
What station?

659
01:35:11,207 --> 01:35:12,708
Woking.

660
01:35:13,334 --> 01:35:14,960
Grab me one of them papers.

661
01:35:15,211 --> 01:35:16,337
Go on!

662
01:35:30,184 --> 01:35:31,602
Can't bear it.

663
01:35:33,437 --> 01:35:34,605
You read it.

664
01:35:35,398 --> 01:35:36,399
Can't bear it?

665
01:35:37,024 --> 01:35:39,235
They'll be spitting at us
in the streets.

666
01:35:40,277 --> 01:35:43,114
If they're not locked up
waiting for the invasion.

667
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:32,121
"Wars are not won by evacuations."

668
01:36:35,916 --> 01:36:37,251
I can't look.

669
01:36:37,626 --> 01:36:39,628
"But there was a victory
inside this deliverance,

670
01:36:39,795 --> 01:36:41,630

whatever the cost—"</i>

680
01:38:16,267 --> 01:38:17,268
What?

681
01:38:17,434 --> 01:38:20,521
"We shall defend our island
whatever the cost may be.

682

"And even if this island
